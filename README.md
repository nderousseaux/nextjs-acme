## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
This project is a training project for learning Next.js App Router, through the [official tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app). It is a simple dashboard app, that has a list of invoices, and a list of customers. The user can navigate between the two lists, and see the details of each invoice or customer.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting started

### Installation
```bash
$ pnpm install
$ cp .env.example .env
```

And fill the `.env` file with the appropriate values. (fill the `AUTH_SECRET` with the output of `openssl rand -base64 32`)

Then, you can go to `localhost:3000/seed` to seed the database with some dummy data.

### Development
```bash
$ pnpm run dev 
#or, with vercel
$ vercel dev
```

### Deployment
```bash
$ vercel --prod
```

Or simply push to the main branch, if you have the vercel integration enabled.
